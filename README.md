>A magical documentation site generator.

### What it is

docsify generates your documentation website on the fly. Unlike GitBook, it does not generate static html files.

To start using it, all you need to do is create an index.html and [deploy it on GitHub Pages](https://docsify.js.org/#/deploy).

- Simple and lightweight (~21kB gzipped)
- Smart full-text search plugin
- Multiple themes
- Useful plugin API
- Compatible with IE11
- Support SSR ([example](https://github.com/docsifyjs/docsify-ssr-demo))
